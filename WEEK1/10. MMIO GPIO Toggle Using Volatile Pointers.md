### 10. MMIO GPIO Toggle Using Volatile Pointers

**Minimal Bare-Metal Snippet:**

```c
int main() {
    volatile uint32_t *gpio = (uint32_t *)0x10012000; *gpio = 0x1;
    while (1);
    return 0;
}
```



**Explanation:**

* `volatile` prevents the compiler from **optimizing away** the store to the GPIO memory address.
* The pointer cast `(uint32_t *)0x10012000` treats the MMIO base address as a pointer to a 32-bit register.
* Writing `*gpio = 0x1;` sets GPIO pin 0 high (toggle can be added later).



**Memory Alignment:**

* `0x10012000` is **4-byte aligned**, which is correct for a `uint32_t` (32-bit value).
* Unaligned memory access can cause **hardware exceptions** on RISC-V.
* MMIO registers must always be accessed with correctly sized and aligned operations.
