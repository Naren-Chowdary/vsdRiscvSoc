### âœ… 6. Stepping with GDB

**Command to launch GDB:**

```
riscv64-unknown-elf-gdb hello.elf`
```

**Inside GDB:**

```gdb
(gdb) target sim                # Use the built-in RISC-V simulator
(gdb) load                      # Load the ELF into simulated memory
(gdb) break main                # Set breakpoint at main()
(gdb) run                       # Start execution
(gdb) info registers            # Inspect all general-purpose registers
(gdb) disassemble               # View disassembly at current PC
(gdb) stepi                     # Step one instruction
(gdb) continue                  # Resume execution until the end
(gdb) quit                      # Exit GDB
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Breakpoint 1, main () at hello.c:4
4       printf("Hello, RISC-V!\n");
```

* `load` is essential to load your program into memory.
* If `break main` fails, use the address shown by disassembly:

  ```gdb
  (gdb) break *0x10118
  ```
