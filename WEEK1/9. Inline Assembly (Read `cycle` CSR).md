### âœ… 9. Inline Assembly (Read `cycle` CSR)

**`hello.c`**

```c
#include <stdint.h>

int main() {
    uint32_t cycle;
    asm volatile ("csrr %0, cycle" : "=r"(cycle));
    while (1);
    return 0;
}
```

**Compile with debug info:**

```bash
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -march=rv32imac -mabi=ilp32 -O0 -g -o hello.elf hello.c
```

**Launch GDB:**

```bash
riscv64-unknown-elf-gdb hello.elf
```

**Inside GDB:**

```gdb
(gdb) target sim
(gdb) load
(gdb) break main
(gdb) run
(gdb) x/w &cycle         # Inspect contents of the 'cycle' variable
(gdb) info registers     # Optional: see where it was stored
```

**Disassemble `main()` to view the generated instructions:**

```gdb
(gdb) disassemble main
```

or use `objdump` outside GDB:

```bash
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d hello.elf > hello.dump
```



**Explanation:**

* `csrr %0, cycle` reads the current CPU cycle count into a register.
* The result is stored in the C variable `cycle` using inline assembly.
* `-g` is required for GDB to understand variable names like `cycle`.
* `x/w &cycle` shows the value of `cycle` in memory after the instruction executes.
